# Project-4-Hangman
This is a project built from everything we have learned in unit 1. Throughout this project the tools that were used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through each tool the site was developed utilizing semantic markup, CSS animations/responsive design, and DOM minipulation. The game is built around the famously known game hangman.
